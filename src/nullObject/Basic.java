/*
 * It is all about building some sort of no object that conforms to the required
 * interface and satisfies a dependency requirement but doesn't do a single
 * thing. it just doesn't do anything it's an empty object. But it does satisfy
 * the interface and it can be passed in instead of NULL and invocations on it
 * donâ€™t cause any exceptions. Motivation: 1. When component A uses B, it
 * assumes B is not null - We inject B, not Option<B> - We do not check for null
 * on every call 2. There is no option of telling A not to use an instance of B
 * - Its mostly hard coded
 *
 * Solution : Build no-op, non-functioning inheritor of B(or some interface that
 * B implements and pass it to A
